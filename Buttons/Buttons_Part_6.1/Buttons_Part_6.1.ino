/*
 * Look back on Part 1.1 (Wonder why the '.1's are related?)
 *   to see how the events were handled.  Props if you already 
 *   included the justPressed and justReleased variabled.  If not,
 *   add boolean arrays justPressed and justReleased to the global
 *   variables.
 * 
 * Add:
 *  - code in the updateButtonState that updates the justPressed
 *      and justReleased variables as well.
 *  - code in the attachButton and detachButton functions which
 *      deals with the justPressed and justReleased arrays.
 *      
 * Write:
 *  - a function, wasPressed, which takes a pin number and returns
 *      the state of justPressed, and sets justPressed to false.
 *  - a function, wasReleased, which takes a pin number and returns
 *      the state of justPreleased, and sets justReleased to false.
