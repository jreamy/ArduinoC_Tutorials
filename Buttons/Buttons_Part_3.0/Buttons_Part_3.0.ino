/*
 * In this file, develop functions to add and remove buttons
 *   from the arrays
 * 
 * Write:
 *  - a function, attachButton, that takes a pin number and adds 
 *      the needed data to the arrays
 *  - a function, detachButton, that takes a pin number and removes
 *      the corresponding data from the arrays, if it is attached
 *      
 * You will need to use the isAttached and pinPosition functions
 *   as well as iterating.
 * 
 * Look up how to remove an alement from an array (how to shift
 *   the rest of the array to overwrite the data in the location)
