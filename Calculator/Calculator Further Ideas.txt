Some things you could do with the program:
 - make the calculator functions able to use floats ('overloading' functions will come up in future examples)
 - make the calculator 'calculate' function take a String and have it parse the input (then you'd need to parse the whole input and send it all at once)
 - make the read function automatically ignore spaces
 - write your own functions (pythagorean theorem, quadratic formula, etc.)
