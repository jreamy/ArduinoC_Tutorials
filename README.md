# Arduino_Tutorials

These "tutorials" (they're really just guided projects) are intended as an introduction to Object Oriented Programming as well as Arduino Programming.

A large portion of learning programming is learning to decipher APIs and Stack Overflow, so the tutorials will get progressively less detailed with the intent of pointing in the right direction instead of dragging you there.

The order in which the tutorials were intended is:
 - Basics
 - Calculator
 - Potentiometer
 - LED_Bar
